                        I was introduced to LS Studios, which I would eventually accept Arren's offer to help make games.<br></p>

                    <p class="text-left text-muted">A: I'm currently working towards... well, I don't know. :/ I love too many things about computers from microcontroller to build robots to small gadgets to coding really cool applications! If anything, my dream would be to work towards
                        contributing for the Hololens (a device where you can see objects virtually implanted in the real world) through app development, as well as any technologies that are related to it. I would also love to study more about game physics,
                        as the WipEout series has been my childhood favorite game (not the show, the racing game).<br></p>

                    <p class="text-left text-muted">A: I was actually thinking about it a few days ago, but one of my dream projects would be to create a game where momentum was the key to the game. Your movement wouldn't be restricted by anything in the air (though your ground movement
                        is slow), but it would be like using the grappling hook to navigate through crevices like a platformer game. It's satisfying to see how your speed isn't affected in the air and builds momentum to where you want to go. Frustration
                        does not belong in any game, including this one.<br></p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="text-left text-muted">A: Well, I just said it a moment ago, but WipEout was one of my favorite games due to how intense the game was. It was like a pseudo Mario Kart, but more futuristic and faster. There's even a mode dedicated to destroying other people,
                        which you can tell is really fun too! Another game is the Ori and the Blind Forest, which introduced to me how satisfying conserving momentum was. It also had a really great soundtrack, which added onto the experience for being
                        orchestrally created (I still listen to it outside of the game).<br></p>
